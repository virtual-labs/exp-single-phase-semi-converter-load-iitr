			"question": "A single phase semi-converter is used to control the speed of the small separately excited dc motor at 4.5 kW, 220 V, 1500 rpm. The converter is connected to a single phase 230 V, 50 Hz supply. The armature resistance is Ra = 0.5 Ω and the armature circuit inductance is L<sub>a</sub> = 10 mH. The motor voltage constant is Kb = 0.1 V/rpm . With the converter operates as a rectifier, the dc motor runs at 1200 rpm and carries an armature current of 16 A. Assume that the motor current is continuous and ripple free. How much is the firing angle?",
